      <p>Sharks are very misunderstood creatures, kind of like the orca whale. If sharks would be humans on the street, they'd have to walk around with a seeing eye dog and a cane, wearing sunglasses, because they're virtually blind. Sharks can only see masses of things. They hunt sea turtles, sea lions, and seals primarily, along with other small fish. Whenever they see a surfer on a surfboard, paddling, they think that it's either one of the aforementioned creatures. Sharks do not look at humans and think, "Yum, a tasty treat," contrary to popular belief.<a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a></p>
